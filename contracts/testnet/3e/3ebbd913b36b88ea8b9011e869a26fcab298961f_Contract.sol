    Doxed to GEN? Have a field that shows this and only I can update it!
    If they dox to me I will update this - they can't update it

    Maybe show the liquidity percent to show how much is burned (as people can always add more LP!)

    CONTRACT SET UP - STEP-BY-STEP!
    -------------------------------
    
    -----------------------
    1. Set External Wallets
    -----------------------
    
    During deployment, all wallets were set to the owner wallet, but you can update them here if required.
    You can keep all 3 wallets the same, there is no need to update them. 

    Once the contract has deployed the wallets can never be changed. So be extremely careful with your private key and pass phrase. 
    Don't use these wallets for anything outside of this project and never connect them to a website that you do not 100% trust.

    Remember, after deploying, your fees can not be changed, and these wallets can not be changed. 
    You definitely do not want a scammer gaining access to the wallet that receives your marketing funds! 

    ----------
    BNB_Wallet
    ----------

    The BNB_Wallet will receive BNB when the contract processes the tokenomics. 
    This is usually used for marketing, but it will depend on the needs of your project.

    Please be sure to explain how you plan to use these funds on your website. So long as you are fully transparent, 
    you can use the BNB for anything! It could be used to pay your team, cover marketing expenses, donate to charity, etc.

    This contact requires a minimum of 1 BNB in liquidity to launch, and that is automatically sent to the burn address
    to protect your investors. If you paid the initial liquidity out of your own pocket, you may want to reimburse that 
    expense from the BNB wallet gradually until it is fully recovered. 

    The golden rule is to tell people. Be honest and fully transparent about how you plan to use this money.

    ------------
    Token_Wallet 
    ------------

    The token wallet is often a better choice than the BNB wallet for taking a fee. 
    This fee is sent to an external wallet in tokens, so it doesn't have a negative impact on your chart. 
    Team members that believe the project will be successful often prefer to get paid in tokens, as their payment will increase in value over time. 

    Tokens collected in this wallet can be used to fund various utilities for your token, such as staking pools, giveaway events,
    and adding additional liquidity etc.

    Again, be fully transparent. Let people know how you plan to use these tokens.

    The token wallet is not excluded from limits, so if your token wallet is full it will not receive any more tokens.
    If this happens, the fee that feeds the token wallet will be set to 0 until there is enough space in the wallet again.

    Your buy and sell fees can be set independently. However, both are limited to a maximum of 12% 
    If you chose the 1% ongoing contract fee it is included in the max fee limit, so the rest of the fees can not be over 9.

    Because this contract will auto-renounce, we can not provide wallet to wallet transfers for free. This feature requires an active owner to 
    update liquidity pairs, so any movement of tokens will incur a fee. This sounds unfair, but it is the default for most contracts. 

    Most developers choose to set the buy fee lower than the sell fee, for this reason, moving tokens when not buying or selling will use
    the buy fee amounts.

    to find your community.

    best link to provide.

    Be sure to add the complete link, including the http as some websites will recognize this and include the link with your token.

    5. Blacklist Bots
    -----------------

    Your contract includes code that will help to protect it from sniper bots, but if you know a wallet is using a bot, it's much better to block them completely.
    When you blacklist a wallet address, that person can never buy your token (or be sent) your token. If they are already holding it they can't sell it
    nor move it to another wallet. 

    Obviously, we are blacklisting wallets before we launch, so they'll never be able to get your token under any circumstances.

    PooCoin have a very handy tool that you can use to see wallet addresses that are actively using sniper bots. It's a good idea to grab those wallets
    and blacklist them. You can access the tool at https://poocoin.app/sniper-watcher

    You might also want to look at other recent tokens that you know got attacked by bots at launch, check the transactions in the first block and it'll be
    clear which are bots. Real people can't buy in the very first second multiple times! Collect up those addresses to and add them to your blacklist.

    -------------
    Anti-Bot Code
    -------------

    Your contract does a pretty good job of protecting itself from sniper bots, but it's not 100% bot-proof (nothing is!)
    The problem is that using code to protect a contract exposes the code, so a bot creator can code a bot to bypass your protection. 
    But 'bot creators' aren't the main problem. Most bot users have no idea how to create a bot, or update one to bypass anti-bot code!
    most bot users bought the bot online and have no idea how it works under the hood. Your contract is pretty well protected from these, but manual blacklisting 
    known bots is always a good idea too. 

    How the Anti-Bot code works 

    Most sniper bots try to buy in the very first second. People can't do that. The tools we use to buy are much too slow to get a transaction to go through that
    quickly. So your contract automatically tags wallets that buy in the first block as bots. It doesn't block them, it allows them to buy, but it very aggressively
    limits how much they can buy. They will only be able to buy 0.01% of total supply. 

    By allowing the bot to buy a tiny amount, it's possible to tag it and prevent it from buying again. So we block the bot for about a minute. Giving real people
    the chance to buy and increase the price so that when the bot can buy again it's no longer interested. 

    I've done a lot of testing with various ways to control bots, and of all the methods I've tried, this is one of the more successful ways of protecting 
    your contract without doing anything too dodgy. Bot users are real people. You can't ethically (and probably legally) just take their money. A lot of devs
    increase fees to 90% if they detect a bot. That's not a good solution, it could get you into trouble and often catches non-bot users by mistake.

    ---------------------
    How to blacklist bots
    ---------------------

    To blacklist wallets, don't do too many at once. Loops require gas and too many wallets will run out of gas! You should be able to do well over 100 
    wallets at a time, but if you have problems, just run the function again with less wallets. 

    You'll likely only need to blacklist 5 or 10 wallets maximum. 

    Obviously, you can not blacklist the contract itself, the liquidity pair or any of the external wallets, that'd break the contract. So we have require statements
    in place to protect against this. If the function keeps failing, double check that you are not accidentally trying to block one of these wallets. It happens 
    more often than you'd expect!

    When adding wallets, keep them comma separated, but without any spaces.

    Remember, once added to the blacklist, they can never be removed!!

    6. Add Liquidity, Renounce Ownership and Launch!
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    When you run this function there is no turning back! Your contract will be live... and your liquidity will already be burned!

    This contract is all about protecting buyers. So it's much more restrictive than most, 100% of your supply will be added to the initial
    liquidity (no exceptions!) along with a minimum of 1 BNB.

    When you add your liquidity and deploy, the contract automatically burns the liquidity. So it's basically locked forever.
    It's the safest option for your holders, but it does mean that you can never get it back, under any circumstances. 
    
    -------------
    Auto Renounce
    -------------

    When you deploy, the contract auto renounces ownership. This means that you can no longer make any changes. Access to all external 
    functions will be lost as soon as you run this function. 
    
    ------------------------------------
    Requires 1 BNB Minimum for Liquidity
    ------------------------------------

    The contract requires a minimum of 1 BNB for the initial liquidity. If you don't have 1 BNB, you can't launch. If you 
    don't have 1 BNB, you really shouldn't be making a token! 

    The 1 BNB (hopefully a lot more) that is added to the initial liquidity is not recoverable. And it shouldn't be! There really is 
    no good reason for the liquidity to ever be removed from any token. However, burning it often seems like a waste to some people, so I'd 
    like to offer the following for you to think about...

    Whatever you put into the initial liquidity will be burned. You can't ever get it back.
    Which is kinda similar to spending money on marketing! You spend your money and you don't get it back! 

    By burning all of your initial Liquidity (and your auto liquidity too) you'll dramatically increase buyer confidence, which will ultimately 
    attract more investors... many more investors than any marketing campaign is likely to attract! Marketing is expensive. An AMA in YouTube will usually
    cost $2k or more. Yet the impact that an AMA can have on your chart will not be as powerful as the impact that burning 100% of your liquidity
    will have. 

    So don't think of it as lost money. It isn't. It's a very savvy investment.
    
    ------------------------------
    Automatic and Free Advertising
    ------------------------------

    Tokens that have been created using this contract are automatically featured on my website. We have a growing number of followers
    that are waiting for safe tokens (like this one) to invest in. Obviously, we can not guarantee that your token will be a success, but we can guarantee 
    that it's much safer than 90% of tokens out there! 

    Just by using this contract, investors will buy your token that otherwise wouldn't have. That's definitely worth burning the liquidity... which, as we
    said before, really should never be removed anyway! 
    
    --------------
    No Going Back!
    --------------
    
    Remember, this is it. When you run this function your contract can not be changed again in any way. So make sure you have everything exactly as you 
    want it before you continue.

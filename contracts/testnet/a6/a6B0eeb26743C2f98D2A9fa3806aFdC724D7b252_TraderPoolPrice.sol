/**
 *  @notice This library is used to convert numbers that use token's N decimals to M decimals.
 *  Comes extremely handy with standardizing the business logic that is intended to work with many different ERC20 tokens
 *  that have different precision (decimals). One can perform calculations with 18 decimals only and resort to convertion
 *  only when the payouts (or interactions) with the actual tokes have to be made.
 *
 *  The best usage scenario involves accepting and calculating values with 18 decimals throughout the project, despite the tokens decimals.
 *
 *  Also it is recommended to call `round18()` function on the first execution line in order to get rid of the
 *  trailing numbers if the destination decimals are less than 18
 *
 *  Example:
 *
 *  contract Taker {
 *      ERC20 public USDC;
 *      uint256 public paid;
 *
 *      . . .
 *
 *      function pay(uint256 amount) external {
 *          uint256 decimals = USDC.decimals();
 *          amount = amount.round18(decimals);
 *
 *          paid += amount;
 *          USDC.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount.from18(decimals));
 *      }
 *  }

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

 * The TraderPool contract is a central business logic contract the DEXE platform is built around. The TraderPool represents
 * a collective pool where investors share its funds and the ownership. The share is represented with the LP tokens and the
 * income is made through the trader's activity. The pool itself is tidily integrated with the UniswapV2 protocol and the trader
 * is allowed to trade with the tokens in this pool. Several safety mechanisms are implemented here: Active Portfolio, Trader Leverage,
 * Proposals, Commissions horizon and simplified onchain PathFinder that protect the user funds

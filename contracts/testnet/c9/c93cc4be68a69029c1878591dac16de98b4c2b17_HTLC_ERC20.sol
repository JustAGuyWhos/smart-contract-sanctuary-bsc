 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

 * @title Hash Time Lock Contract (HTLC) ERC20
 *
 * @author Meheret Tesfaye Batu <[email protected]>
 *
 * HTLC -> A Hash Time Lock Contract is essentially a type of payment in which two people
 * agree to a financial arrangement where one party will pay the other party a certain amount
 * of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum assets.
 * However, because these contracts are Time-Locked, the receiving party only has a certain
 * amount of time to accept the payment, otherwise the money can be returned to the sender.
 *
 * Hash-Locked -> A Hash locked functions like “two-factor authentication” (2FA). It requires
 * the intended recipient to provide the correct secret passphrase to withdraw the funds.
 *
 * Time-Locked -> A Time locked adds a “timeout” expiration date to a payment. It requires
 * the intended recipient to claim the funds prior to the expiry. Otherwise, the transaction
 * defaults to enabling the original sender of funds to withdraw a refund.

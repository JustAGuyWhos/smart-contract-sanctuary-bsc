/** ****************************************************************************
 * @notice Interface for contracts using VRF randomness
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev PURPOSE
 *
 * @dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness
 * @dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not
 * @dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key
 * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to
 * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely
 * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.
 *
 * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was
 * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,
 * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample
 * @dev from the output space.
 *
 * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts
 * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide
 * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness.
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev USAGE
 *
 * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can
 * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as
 * @dev shown:
 *
 * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {
 * @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)
 * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link) public {
 * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>
 * @dev       }
 * @dev   }
 *
 * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have
 * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash), and have told you the minimum LINK
 * @dev price for VRF service. Make sure your contract has sufficient LINK, and
 * @dev call requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, seed), where seed is the input you
 * @dev want to generate randomness from.
 *
 * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response
 * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomness method.
 *
 * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomness is the actual random value
 * @dev generated from your seed.
 *
 * @dev The requestId argument is generated from the keyHash and the seed by
 * @dev makeRequestId(keyHash, seed). If your contract could have concurrent
 * @dev requests open, you can use the requestId to track which seed is
 * @dev associated with which randomness. See VRFRequestIDBase.sol for more
 * @dev details. (See "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS" for principles to keep in mind,
 * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.)
 *
 * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds
 * @dev differ. (Which is critical to making unpredictable randomness! See the
 * @dev next section.)
 *
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
 *
 * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly
 * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that
 * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract
 * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).
 *
 * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free
 * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all
 * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your
 * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or
 * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any
 * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be
 * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.
 *
 * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence
 * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if
 * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,
 * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot
 * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.
 *
 * @dev Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the
 * @dev block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact
 * @dev on its economic security properties. They are only included for API
 * @dev compatability with previous versions of this contract.
 *
 * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness
 * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful
 * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block
 * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a
 * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input
 * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic
 * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits
 * @dev until it calls responds to a request.
